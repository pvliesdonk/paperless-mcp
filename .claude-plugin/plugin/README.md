# Paperless MCP — Claude Code plugin

Installs the `paperless-mcp` MCP server into Claude Code as a plugin.
The server itself is launched with `uvx` from the released PyPI package
pinned in `.mcp.json`; both that pin and `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`'s
`version` are bumped automatically in every release commit by
`scripts/bump_manifests.py`, so the plugin always installs the release it
shipped with.

## Configuration

`.mcp.json`'s `env` block is this project's to own: add the environment
variables the server needs at launch. Values may reference plugin
`userConfig` entries as `${user_config.<id>}` — declare those in
`plugin.json` (exec-form substitution only; shell-form command strings
reject them).

## Skills

Drop skill directories under `skills/` (each with a `SKILL.md`) to ship
agent guidance alongside the server. None are scaffolded by default.
