# Docker Deployment

## Quick start

```
docker compose up -d
```

The server listens on port 8000 with HTTP transport by default.

## Image tags

| Tag          | Contents                                                     | Updated by                                           |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `latest`     | Newest stable release                                        | Each stable release that is newest across all series |
| `vX.Y.Z`     | That exact release (pre-releases included, as `vX.Y.Z-rc.N`) | Never (immutable)                                    |
| `vX.Y`, `vX` | Newest stable release in that series                         | Each stable release that is newest in its series     |
| `rc`         | Newest release candidate                                     | Each pre-release still ahead of `latest`             |
| `edge`       | Newest commit on `main`                                      | Every merge to `main`                                |

Rolling tags are ordering-aware: a patch release cut from an old `release/X.Y` branch after a newer stable has shipped updates its own series tags but never `latest`. The same rule governs `rc`: a candidate only moves the tag while its version is still ahead of the newest stable, so a candidate for an already-released version never pulls `rc` behind `latest`.

The three rolling tags answer different questions. Use `latest` to run released code, `rc` to test the candidate for the next release, and `edge` to run the newest merged commit. Note that `rc` is not cleared when its release ships: it keeps pointing at the last candidate until the next one is cut, so `latest` is the tag to follow in production. To find the commit behind an `edge` image, read its `org.opencontainers.image.revision` label:

```
docker inspect --format '{{ index .Config.Labels "org.opencontainers.image.revision" }}' \
  ghcr.io/pvliesdonk/paperless-mcp:edge
```

## Environment variables

| Variable                     | Default               | Description                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PAPERLESS_MCP_BEARER_TOKEN` | n/a                   | Enable bearer token auth                                                                                      |
| `FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL`          | `INFO`                | Log level (`DEBUG` / `INFO` / `WARNING` / `ERROR`)                                                            |
| `PAPERLESS_MCP_INSTRUCTIONS` | (computed at startup) | System instructions for LLM context                                                                           |
| `PAPERLESS_MCP_DEBUG_PORT`   | n/a                   | Remote-debugger TCP port (see [Remote debugging](#remote-debugging); requires `--build-arg DEBUG=true` image) |
| `PAPERLESS_MCP_DEBUG_WAIT`   | `false`               | Block startup until IDE attaches (see [Remote debugging](#remote-debugging))                                  |

For OIDC auth variables, see [Authentication](https://pvliesdonk.github.io/paperless-mcp/unstable/guides/authentication/index.md).

Running behind a reverse proxy on a path prefix (`https://mcp.example.com/myservice/mcp`) rather than its own hostname needs two routing rules, one of which sits outside the prefix: see [Subpath Deployments](https://pvliesdonk.github.io/paperless-mcp/unstable/deployment/oidc/#subpath-deployments).

## Volumes

| Path            | Purpose                                        |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `/data/service` | Your service data (bind-mount or named volume) |
| `/data/state`   | State files (FastMCP OIDC state, etc.)         |

## UID/GID

Set `PUID` and `PGID` in your `.env` file to match the owner of bind-mounted directories (default 1000/1000).

## Remote debugging

Production images ship without `debugpy` to keep the image lean. To attach a remote Python debugger from VS Code or PyCharm:

1. **Build with the debug extra:**

   ```
   docker build --build-arg DEBUG=true -t paperless-mcp:debug .
   ```

   This installs the `[debug]` optional-dependency group (which pulls `debugpy` transitively from `fastmcp-pvl-core`). Default builds (`DEBUG=false`) skip it.

1. **Run with the debug env vars set and the port mapped:**

   ```
   docker run --rm \
     -e PAPERLESS_MCP_DEBUG_PORT=5678 \
     -e PAPERLESS_MCP_DEBUG_WAIT=true \
     -p 127.0.0.1:5678:5678 \
     -p 8000:8000 \
     paperless-mcp:debug
   ```

   | Env var                    | Effect                                                                                                                                            |
   | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | `PAPERLESS_MCP_DEBUG_PORT` | TCP port the debugger listens on (any value parsing to `0` disables; non-numeric or out-of-range values log a WARNING and the listener stays off) |
   | `PAPERLESS_MCP_DEBUG_WAIT` | When truthy (`1`/`true`/`yes`/`on`), block startup until the IDE attaches. Default is non-blocking.                                               |

1. **Attach from VS Code**, adding a launch config:

   ```
   {
     "name": "Attach to paperless-mcp",
     "type": "debugpy",
     "request": "attach",
     "connect": { "host": "localhost", "port": 5678 }
   }
   ```

   PyCharm uses *Run → Edit Configurations → Python Debug Server* with the same host/port.

Never publish the debug port on a public network

The debug listener binds `0.0.0.0` inside the container so the IDE can reach it from the host, but **debugpy's DAP protocol is unauthenticated**: any peer that can reach the port has arbitrary code execution as the server process. Always bind the port mapping to localhost (`-p 127.0.0.1:5678:5678`) or tunnel via `kubectl port-forward` / SSH. Production images should be built with default `DEBUG=false`.

When the helper is invoked but `debugpy` isn't installed (say, someone sets `DEBUG_PORT` on a non-debug image), it logs a WARNING and continues; this is the safe failure mode.
