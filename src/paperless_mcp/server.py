    # -- Transfer subsystem (capability-link upload + download) ----------------
    #
    # Wiring the /transfer/{token} route needs HTTP transport (the route cannot
    # be served under stdio) and, at build time, base_url — pvl-core raises
    # ConfigurationError when it is unset, so gate only on the transport and let
    # that error surface a misconfigured deployment rather than silently
    # dropping the feature. Requires fastmcp-pvl-core >= 4.8.0.
    #
    # First compose a TransferConfig into ProjectConfig (config.py): add
    # ``TransferConfig`` to its ``from fastmcp_pvl_core import (...)`` block, then
    # a ``transfer: TransferConfig = field(default_factory=TransferConfig)`` field
    # in CONFIG-FIELDS and ``transfer=TransferConfig.from_env(_ENV_PREFIX),`` in
    # CONFIG-FROM-ENV. The second line is required — without it the
    # PAPERLESS_MCP_TRANSFER_* env vars are ignored and the defaults always win.
    #
    # Path 1 — the generic tools, the common case. Registers create_download_link
    # and create_upload_link with pvl-core's shared metadata (names, icons, tags):
    #
    # if transport != "stdio":
    #     from fastmcp_pvl_core import register_transfer_routes
    #
    #     register_transfer_routes(
    #         mcp,
    #         config.server,
    #         config.transfer,          # TransferConfig composed into ProjectConfig
    #         sink=_my_transfer_sink,   # implements TransferSink (read/write)
    #         validate=_my_validator,   # TransferValidator: (ref, kind) -> handle
    #         # download_note/upload_note (optional) append a domain sentence to
    #         # the generic tool descriptions — context only, no shape change.
    #     )
    #
    # Path 2 — your own tool over the same capability-link machinery, when the
    # generic pair cannot express it (a different name, a domain-accurate
    # description, domain-specific parameters). build_transfer_links mounts the
    # route and returns a minter, registering no tools; your tool validates the
    # caller ref itself, then mints over the already-validated sink handle:
    #
    # if transport != "stdio":
    #     from fastmcp_pvl_core import build_transfer_links
    #
    #     links = build_transfer_links(
    #         mcp, config.server, config.transfer, sink=_my_transfer_sink
    #     )

    #         return await links.mint_download(handle)
    # DOMAIN-WIRING-END

    # Operator tool visibility (PAPERLESS_MCP_TOOLS_ALLOW /
