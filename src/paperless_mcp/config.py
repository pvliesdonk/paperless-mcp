"""Configuration for Paperless MCP.

Composes :class:`fastmcp_pvl_core.ServerConfig` via the domain
:class:`ProjectConfig` dataclass — never inherits.

Add domain-specific fields between the CONFIG-FIELDS sentinels, populate
them in ``from_env`` between the CONFIG-FROM-ENV sentinels, and enforce
their invariants in ``__post_init__`` between the CONFIG-VALIDATE
sentinels; copier update preserves all three blocks across template
updates.

    A module-level factory rather than a read inside `from_env`, for two
    reasons that both bite if it moves:

    - The generator AST-scans `ProjectConfig.from_env` for literal
      ``env(prefix, "SUFFIX")`` calls and turns each into a *domain* var.
      ``PAPERLESS_MCP_SERVER_NAME`` is already declared with template
      provenance in the template's `config-presentation.yml`, so a read in
      `from_env` would be discovered twice and fail generation with the
      duplicate-name error. `docs/design/config-migration.md` documents this
      case and prescribes exactly this workaround; the scan only walks
      `from_env`, so a module-level helper stays invisible to it.
    - As a ``default_factory`` the env read happens per construction, so
      ``ProjectConfig()`` still honours the environment while
      ``ProjectConfig(server_name=...)`` wins outright — which is the whole
      point of the field.

        home for a field invariant: ``env_float`` / ``env_int`` bounds check
        only the *env-sourced* value, never the default, so a direct
        construction slips past them.  They also cannot express an exclusive
        bound (their ``minimum`` / ``maximum`` are inclusive, so "must be > 0"
        lets ``0`` through) or a cross-field rule (A requires B,
        mutually-exclusive pairs).  All three belong here.
